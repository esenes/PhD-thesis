In the reactive near zone, it replicates the Coulomb fields of the electron and its image charge and their evolution into radiation fields after termination of the charge\&\#x2019;s current at the screen. Using a general formulation for radiation diffraction from a current line, we derive diffraction integral expressions in the reactive near zone, the Fresnel near zone, and the Fraunhofer far zone in analogy to diffraction from a planar radiation source. The derived exact complex field expressions can be useful for describing coherent optical TR from a beam of phase-correlated charge particles in the near field and in the imaging plane of the screen.},
